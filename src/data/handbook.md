About This Handbook
This handbook was developed to provide information about the company’s policies, practices, programs, and benefits. The handbook applies to all employees. It is important to read, understand, and comply with all handbook provisions. If you have any questions about the handbook, please contact your manager or Pauli Morales.
This handbook is not a binding contract between the company and its employees and is not intended to alter the at-will employment relationship. It’s also important to remember that this handbook provides general guidelines, and other information, such as benefit plans, will be described in other documents.
The company reserves the right to modify, rescind, delete, or add to the provisions of this handbook at any time, consistent with applicable law. The company also reserves the right to interpret the policies in this handbook at its discretion.
This handbook supersedes and replaces any and all employee policies and manuals previously distributed or made available to employees.

Employment-At-Will
Employment with Regenta Inc. is at-will. This means that either you or the company may terminate your employment at any time, for any reason, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Nothing in this employee handbook or in any oral or written statement limits the right to terminate employment-at-will unless otherwise dictated by state law. Only the President of the company has the authority to enter into an employment agreement with any employee providing for employment other than at-will, and any such agreement must be in writing.
With the exception of employment-at-will, which can only be altered by the President, the terms and conditions of your employment with Regenta Inc. may be modified at the sole discretion of the company, with or without cause or notice, at any time. No implied contract concerning any employment-related decision, term, or condition of employment can be established by any other statement, conduct, policy, or practice.

Mission Statement

Our company exists to create value for our customers by delivering a world-class product.

Equal Employment Opportunity
Regenta Inc. is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate against employees or applicants on the basis of an individual’s race, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), color, religion, national origin, age, disability, military or veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law. This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including recruitment, hiring, placement, compensation, promotion, discipline, and termination.
Regenta Inc. is committed to complying with all applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and relevant state laws. It is our policy not to discriminate against any qualified employee or applicant because of their disability. Consistent with this policy of non-discrimination, the company will evaluate requests for accommodation through an “interactive process” and will provide a reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with a disability, allowing them to perform the essential functions of their job, provided such accommodation does not constitute an undue hardship to the company. The company reserves the right to propose an alternative accommodation, so long as such accommodation is equally effective in accommodating the disability.
Any employee or job applicant who has questions regarding this policy, would like to request an accommodation, or believes they have been discriminated against, should notify their manager or Pauli Morales. Any individual who reports conduct in violation of this policy or participates in an investigation will not be retaliated against. If you believe that you have experienced retaliation, please report your concerns to your manager or Pauli Morales.

Open Door Policy
Regenta Inc. values each employee and strives to provide a positive work experience. In any organization, however, disagreements among employees or between managers and employees may occasionally arise. In most situations, the individuals directly involved will resolve these disagreements on their own. If that cannot be accomplished, our Open Door Policy provides an effective path toward resolution. If you have a job-related concern, complaint, or suggestion, you are encouraged to speak to your manager, Pauli Morales, or any member of management at any time. Regenta Inc. takes your concerns seriously, and every employee is encouraged to speak up.

Employment Policies

Employee Categories
All employees are designated as either non-exempt or exempt under state and federal wage and hour laws. The following is intended to help employees understand employment classifications, status, and benefit eligibility. These classifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time. The right to terminate the employment-at-will relationship at any time is retained by both the employee and Regenta Inc..
Each employee is designated as either non-exempt or exempt from federal and state wage and hour laws. Non-exempt employees are typically paid hourly and are entitled to overtime pay under the specific provisions of federal and state laws. Exempt employees are usually paid on a salary basis and are excluded from specific provisions of federal and state wage and hour laws. An employee’s exempt or non-exempt classification may be changed only upon written notification by Regenta Inc. management.
In addition to the above categories, each employee will belong to one of the following employment categories:
Regular Full-Time: These are employees who are not in temporary or probationary status and are regularly scheduled to work the organization's full-time schedule (35 hours or more per week).
Regular Part-Time: A part-time employee is an individual who is hired for an indefinite period, but who works less than a normal workweek. Part-time employees may work irregular hours, regularly scheduled hours every workday, or full workdays but less than 5 days per week. A common definition of part-time employment is scheduled to work less than 35 hours per week.
Temporary Employee: A “temporary employee” means an individual whose employment is limited in duration and is hired for a specific short-term project, or on a temporary basis. Temporary employees are not eligible for company benefits unless required by applicable law.

Performance Reviews
The company may periodically evaluate an employee’s performance. The goal of a performance review is to identify areas where an employee excels and areas that may need improvement. The company uses performance reviews as a tool to give feedback and to determine pay increases, promotions, coaching, disciplinary action, and/or termination. Employees should note that a performance review does not guarantee a pay increase or promotion. Written or verbal performance evaluations may be made at any time to advise employees of unacceptable performance.
Performance reviews are typically conducted {performancereviewperiod}. Your manager will discuss your performance review with you, and both you and your manager will sign the review to ensure that all strengths, areas for improvement, and job goals for the next review period have been clearly communicated and understood. Performance evaluations will be retained in your personnel file.
In addition to these formal performance evaluations, the company encourages you and your manager to discuss your job performance and career development on a frequent and ongoing basis.

Nursing Parents Policy
Regenta Inc. supports breastfeeding parents by accommodating those who wish to express breast milk during the workday while they are separated from a nursing child.
For up to one year after the child’s birth, any employee who is breastfeeding their child will be provided reasonable break times as needed to express breast milk. Regenta Inc. will designate a private, non-bathroom space for this purpose as needed. If applicable, these breaks may run concurrent with scheduled or paid break times but are otherwise considered unpaid unless designated by state law. If this Nursing Parents Policy differs from applicable law, the more generous of the two will apply.
Additionally, the company permits the storage of expressed breast milk at the workplace, either in a refrigerator or an employee-provided cooler, so long as the storage container is clearly labeled. Employees storing milk at the workplace assume all responsibility for the safety of the milk and the risk of harm for any reason, including improper storage, refrigeration, and tampering. Any questions regarding the Nursing Parents Policy may be directed to Pauli Morales.

Pregnancy and Childbirth Accommodations
In accordance with the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) and applicable state or local laws, the company is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for employees and applicants with known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on business operations.
Examples of Reasonable Accommodations
Accommodations will be determined on a case-by-case basis through an interactive process between the employee and the company. Examples may include, but are not limited to:
Additional break time for rest, restroom use, meals, and hydration.
Seating accommodations for jobs that typically require standing or vice versa.
Schedule adjustments, remote work, or light-duty assignments.
A temporary modification of job duties or restructuring of non-essential tasks.
Access to a private space (not a restroom) for lactation needs.
Modified uniforms, equipment, or devices.
Temporary leave or reduced hours when necessary.
Requesting an Accommodation
Employees or applicants who need an accommodation should notify their supervisor or Pauli Morales as soon as possible. Requests should include:
A description of the limitation requiring accommodation.
The type of accommodation being requested.
How the accommodation will help address the limitation.
In some cases, medical documentation may be requested to better assess the need for accommodation, except where:
The limitation is obvious.
The company is already aware of the limitations.
The company does not normally require documentation in similar situations.
The request is for accommodations presumed reasonable, such as additional breaks for restroom use, eating, drinking, or lactation needs, carrying or keeping water, or seating adjustments.
Interactive Process & Undue Hardship Consideration
The company will engage in an interactive discussion with the requesting employee to explore potential accommodations. While efforts will be made to meet requests, certain accommodations may not be granted if they impose an undue hardship, such as significantly affecting business operations, safety, or financial feasibility.
Leave as an Accommodation
If necessary, leave may be provided as a reasonable accommodation. Such leave may run concurrently with other applicable leave policies, including the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or state and local leave laws. However, the company will not require leave if another reasonable accommodation is available.
Protection from Retaliation
No employee or applicant will face retaliation, discrimination, or adverse action for requesting or using an accommodation under this policy. Employees who believe they have experienced retaliation should report concerns immediately to Pauli Morales.
The company remains committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive work environment for all employees affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.

Progressive Discipline Policy
Regenta Inc. strives to follow a policy of progressive discipline in which it attempts to provide employees with notice of performance deficiencies or unacceptable behavior and an opportunity to improve. Discipline may take the form of verbal warnings, written warnings, probation, suspension, demotion, transfer, termination, or some other disciplinary action. The course of action will be determined by the company in its sole discretion as it deems appropriate. The discipline imposed under this policy will be determined based on the severity of the violation.
Documentation of each violation will be kept in the employee's personnel file. The employee may ask for a copy of the documentation at any time. Although they may not necessarily agree with the disciplinary action, employees are expected to sign a form acknowledging that disciplinary action has been taken against them and add any comments they deem necessary. Nothing in this policy should be interpreted as modifying the employment-at-will relationship between Regenta Inc. and its employees.

Time Away from Work and Other Benefits

Benefits Overview
This handbook contains descriptions of some of our current employee benefits. Many of the company’s benefit plans are described in more formal plan documents available from Pauli Morales. In the event of any inconsistencies between this handbook or any other oral or written description of benefits and a formal plan document, the formal plan document will govern.
The information presented here is intended to serve only as an overview. The details of specific benefit plans are available from Pauli Morales. Regenta Inc. reserves the right to modify, amend, or terminate these benefits at any time and for any reason.

Paid Holidays
Regenta Inc. observes the following holidays: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day (4th of July), Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day

Regular full-time employees will be paid for these holidays. Please check with Pauli Morales for more information.

Time Away from Work

Paid Time Off (PTO)
Eligible employees are entitled to accrue paid time off (PTO) to use for vacation time, sick time, or other personal reasons. All regular full-time employees are entitled to accrue PTO from their date of hire at the rate of 1.6 hours for every 40 hours worked. Part-time and temporary employees are not eligible for PTO.
If the need to use PTO is foreseeable, employees must provide at least 10 business days’ notice to their manager. If the need to use PTO is not foreseeable, the employee must provide notice as soon as possible. Employees must get approval from their manager prior to scheduling or using PTO, unless the need for PTO was an unforeseeable situation that prevented the employee from notifying their manager. Employees must also enter their PTO into the company’s tracking system.
PTO requests are not guaranteed to be approved; approval will be based on factors impacting the business, including seasonality, staffing levels, and/or previous PTO requests. PTO approval is at the sole discretion of management. Employees are encouraged to proactively discuss their PTO needs with their manager and to schedule PTO as far in advance as possible to ensure smooth operations for the company and their department.
In order to use PTO, employees must have accrued PTO available. The company does not allow employees to borrow against future expected accruals. Employees must use PTO in the year in which it is earned. Accrued but unused PTO will not carry over into the next year and will not be paid out upon termination unless required by applicable law. For states that require carry-over of accrued PTO, an employee will cease accruing PTO when they have accumulated the maximum amount allowable, until such time as they use any or all of those days. Upon their use of any or all of those days, accrual will resume at the regular rate until they have again reached the maximum. If state law also provides leave, the more generous accrual rate may apply.
If a company-observed holiday falls during your use of PTO, you will receive holiday pay for the day, and the day will not be charged to your accrued PTO. PTO will be paid at the employee’s regular straight-time rate of pay or base salary for the approved PTO period. PTO is not considered hours worked for the purpose of calculating an employee's entitlement to overtime pay.

Health Insurance
Regenta Inc. makes group health benefits available to eligible full-time employees after 90 days of continuous employment. Upon becoming eligible to participate in these plans, you will receive additional information about plan benefits and enrollment. The company determines the plan carrier, specifics, and employer contribution, which are subject to change. If you have questions about our insurance programs, please contact Pauli Morales.

Dental Benefits
After completing 90 days of employment, employees are eligible to enroll in the company's dental insurance plan. Detailed information about the dental insurance plan, including coverage specifics and enrollment procedures, will be provided during the onboarding process.

Retirement Plan
Regular full-time employees may be eligible to participate in the company’s retirement plan after 90 days of continuous employment. This benefit provides a valuable opportunity to save for the future, with options for pre-tax and post-tax contributions. Please contact Pauli Morales or refer to the plan documentation for further details.

Jury Duty
Regenta Inc. understands that it is the obligation of all U.S. citizens to serve on a jury when summoned to do so. All employees will be allowed time off to perform such civic service as required by law. Some states may require paid jury duty. Employees should consult with Pauli Morales regarding state-specific policies that may apply.
Employees who are selected for jury duty must provide a copy of their jury summons to their manager and Pauli Morales.

Military Leave
Employees taking part in a variety of military duties may be eligible for unpaid military leave. Such military duties include leaves of absence taken by members of the uniformed services, including Reservists and National Guard members, for training, periods of active military service, and funeral honors duty, as well as time spent being examined to determine fitness to perform such service.
The company will grant such leave in accordance with applicable state and federal laws, provided all legal requirements are satisfied and the employee returns to work or applies for reemployment within the time prescribed by law. Except as required by applicable law, all military leave is unpaid. However, employees may use any or all of their accrued but unused vacation or other paid time off during their military service leave.
Employees requesting leave for military duty should contact Pauli Morales to request leave as soon as they are aware of the need for leave.

Unpaid Leaves of Absence
Occasionally, employees may need to take a temporary leave of absence. These can be for personal, medical, or other reasons. In certain circumstances, you may wish to be temporarily released from the duties of your position with Regenta Inc., but may not want to submit your resignation. Under certain circumstances, you may be eligible for an unpaid leave of absence and should speak with Pauli Morales. Approval will depend on the employee’s performance, department needs, business circumstances, and potential disruption to the team.

On the Job Practices and Policies

Employment Records
In order to obtain employment, all employees are required to provide the company with personal information such as their legal name, address, and telephone number. This information is saved in the employee’s personnel file. Please inform Pauli Morales of any changes to your personal information, including your emergency contact. Changes to your address, marital status, etc., can affect your withholding tax and benefits coverage, so it is crucial to notify the company of any changes promptly.
Employee personnel files may be kept in hard copy, electronically, or in a combination of the two. Upon written request, the company will permit employees to inspect their personnel file. Employees should contact Pauli Morales to schedule a time to view their personnel file. State law may provide additional rights to employees related to obtaining personnel records. Employees should consult with Pauli Morales for state-specific policies.

Payroll
All employees of the company are paid twice a month. The company takes care to ensure that employees receive the correct amount of pay in each paycheck and that they are paid promptly on the scheduled payday.
By law, the company is required to make deductions for Social Security, federal income tax, and any other mandatory deductions. These required deductions may also include any court-ordered garnishments.
The company complies with state and federal wage and hour laws and prohibits improper payroll deductions. If you believe there is an error in your pay, bring the matter to the attention of Shane Javery immediately. If an error is discovered, you will be reimbursed for the appropriate amount, no later than the following pay date.

Direct Deposit
Regenta Inc. encourages employees to have their pay directly deposited into their bank accounts via direct deposit. Employees who wish to enroll in direct deposit can do so through Shane Javery.

Overtime
Non-exempt employees may be required to work beyond their regularly scheduled workday at the request of their manager. Employees are expected to cooperate with such requests.
Unless otherwise required by applicable state and federal laws, non-exempt employees will be paid an overtime premium of one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty per workweek.
Your manager is responsible for monitoring business activity and requesting overtime work if necessary. An effort will be made to provide you with advance notice in such situations, but it may not always be possible.

Timekeeping
Non-exempt employees must keep accurate records of time worked. Non-exempt employees will be paid for all hours worked, including fractional parts of an hour. All employees are expected to be at their workstations, ready to work at the beginning of their shift. It is up to the employee to report all time worked and to work within the scheduled and approved work hours.
Altering, falsifying, or tampering with time records, as well as recording time on another employee’s time record, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
It is your responsibility to certify the accuracy of all time recorded. Any errors in your time record should be reported immediately to your manager, who will attempt to correct legitimate errors.
The company prohibits all non-exempt employees from performing any work without recording their time for payroll purposes. No one at the company is authorized to work off the clock, and no one at the company has the authority to require any employee to perform off-the-clock work.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding your hours or if you have worked off the clock or are aware of any violations of the company's timekeeping policies, you should contact your manager or Pauli Morales. The company will not retaliate against you for such reports or complaints.

Punctuality and Attendance
Employees are expected to arrive on time and be ready for work. Managers will provide employees with their work schedules. If an employee has any questions regarding their work schedule, they should contact their manager. The company does not tolerate tardiness or absenteeism without communication and an acceptable excuse. Excessive unexcused tardiness or absenteeism may result in disciplinary action. Employees who will be late to or absent from work should notify their manager in advance, or as soon as practicable in the event of an emergency. Employees who need to leave early, for illness or otherwise, should inform their manager before departure. Unauthorized departures may result in disciplinary action.
An employee who fails to report for their scheduled workday and has not notified their manager of their tardiness or absence within the first two hours of their scheduled shift will be considered a No Call No Show (NCNS). Two consecutive NCNSs are considered job abandonment and will be designated as a voluntary resignation. In the case of job abandonment, the employee’s final date of employment for purposes of payroll and welfare benefits will be their last day actually worked.
We do recognize that there are times when absences and tardiness cannot be avoided. In such cases, you are expected to notify your manager as early as possible, but no later than the start of your workday. Asking another employee, friend, or relative to give this notice is improper unless it is an emergency situation. Please call or email your manager, stating the nature of your absence and its expected duration, for every day you are or plan to be absent.

Meal and Rest Breaks
Employees will be provided with meal and rest periods as required by law. Your manager or Pauli Morales will provide further details.

Employees have a duty to immediately notify their managers, security or workplace personnel, human resources, or senior management of any suspicious behavior, concerning situations, or acts of physical violence that they observe or are aware of that involve other employees, former employees, customers, suppliers, visitors, or other parties associated with the company. These situations include, for example, threats or acts of violence, aggressive or intimidating behavior, threatening or offensive comments or remarks, or similar behavior. Employee concerns raised under this policy will be held in confidence to the maximum possible extent. The company will not permit any form of retaliation against any employee who raises concerns in good faith.
Regenta Inc. will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats or incidents of actual violence and suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the individual making a report will be protected as much as possible. To maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, the company may suspend employees suspected of workplace violence or threats of violence, either with or without pay, pending investigation.
Employees with an order for victim protection identifying Regenta Inc. as their workplace are encouraged to notify Pauli Morales. Any such report will be kept confidential to the greatest extent possible.
Anyone found to be responsible for threats of or actual violence or other conduct that violates these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Every company must have standards of conduct to guide the behavior of employees.

Employees should have no expectation of privacy when on company grounds or while using company property. All documents, files, voice mails, and electronic information, including emails and other communications, created, received, or maintained on or through company property are the property of the company, not the employee.
Upon termination, employees are required to surrender any company property they possess. Files or programs stored on company computers may not be copied for personal use. The company’s computer, email, and Internet access systems are for business use only. As such, you agree and understand that the company may monitor these systems, including the full content of any messages therein, without further disclosure to you.
The company requires you to follow its rules. These rules are in no way an exhaustive list:
Do not share your user login credentials or passwords with anyone. No employee may attempt to access another employee’s computer systems or data without authorization.
Do not install unapproved apps. Employees should not delete, examine, copy, or modify files and/or data belonging to other users without their consent.

You must also promptly provide the company with access to company devices when requested.

Employee-Owned Communication Devices
The purpose of this policy is to define standards, procedures, and restrictions for employees who have legitimate business reasons for connecting a personally-owned device to the company’s corporate systems or network.
The policy applies to any hardware and related software that is employee-owned or supplied and is used to access company resources or perform work for the company. The overriding goal of this policy is to protect the integrity of the confidential client and business data that resides within the company’s technology infrastructure. Employees are required to secure their personal devices in such a way as to prevent access by unauthorized users. A data breach could result in loss of information, damage to critical applications, loss of revenue, and damage to the company’s reputation. Therefore, all employees using a personal device that is connected to the company’s network and capable of backing up, storing, or otherwise accessing corporate data of any type, must use and secure their device in such a way as to protect the company’s assets.
All materials, data, communications, and information created on, transmitted to, received or printed from, or stored or recorded on an employee-owned device, for purposes of conducting the company's business or on behalf of the company, are the property of the company, regardless of who owns the device at issue. The company reserves the right to monitor, inspect, and review any work-related communications, data, information, or work product created by, stored by, recorded by, printed from, transmitted to, or received by employees on such personal electronic devices.
Any use of a personal mobile device for business purposes must conform to the company’s policies and processes, and each user is responsible for using their device in a productive, professional, ethical, and lawful manner.

Personal Visitors and Phone Usage
Disruptions during working hours can lead to errors and delays. Therefore, we ask that personal telephone calls and messaging be kept to a minimum. For safety and security reasons, employees are prohibited from having personal guests visit or accompany them in areas other than the reception areas unless otherwise approved by their manager.

Workplace Searches
The company prioritizes the safety, protection, and well-being of employees and its business interests. The company reserves the right to search all company property for all business purposes, including compliance with company policies, protecting the company's rights, property, and interests, investigating breaches of security, and investigating possible violations of the law. Employees should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to company property. Examples of company property include company-provided vehicles, desks, filing cabinets, workstations, equipment, computers, and lockers.
Employees are expected to cooperate in the conduct of any search or inspection.

Smoking
Smoking is not allowed on Regenta Inc. premises. This includes vaping or using e-cigarettes. Smoking is prohibited in all company-owned, rented, or leased vehicles.

Confidential Company Information
The protection of the company’s confidential business information and trade secrets is vital to the interests and success of our organization. “Confidential information” is information belonging to the company but not generally known to the public, including, but not limited to: customer lists and contact information, price lists, financial information, marketing plans, business strategies, and sensitive employee information. Anyone who discloses confidential information without authorization will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, even if they do not benefit from the disclosed information. This duty of confidentiality applies whether the employee is on or off company premises, during and even after the end of the employee's employment with the company.
It is important that all confidential information remains confidential and not be disclosed to others. Any employee who improperly copies, removes (whether physically or electronically), uses, or discloses confidential information to anyone outside of the company without authorization may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Employees may be required to sign an agreement reiterating these obligations.
In the event of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, employees must immediately inform their manager. Any employee who is unsure whether information should be kept confidential should always check with their manager before disclosing the information.

No Solicitation / No Distribution
Regenta Inc. works hard to build a cooperative culture. As such, employees may not solicit for any cause or distribute literature of any kind, for any purpose during working time.
Non-employees are not permitted to solicit employees or distribute materials for any purpose on company property at any time.

Conflict of Interest Policy
Employees are expected to act in the best interests of the company and its clients by identifying and managing potential conflicts of interest. Employees must disclose any potential conflicts of interest immediately and follow procedures to manage these conflicts to maintain professional integrity.
Disclosure and Documentation
Employees must disclose any personal, financial, or other interests that could potentially conflict with their professional responsibilities. This includes relationships with clients, vendors, or competitors that could influence decision-making.
When a potential conflict of interest is identified, the employee must report it to their supervisor. The company will assess the situation and determine the appropriate course of action, which may include recusal from certain projects or clients.
Employees must avoid any actions that could create the appearance of a conflict of interest. This includes accepting gifts, favors, or other benefits from clients or vendors that could influence professional judgment. Any offers of gifts or benefits must be reported to a supervisor.
Employees should maintain records of disclosed conflicts and actions taken to mitigate them. This documentation helps ensure transparency and accountability.
Failure to disclose or manage conflicts of interest could damage the company's reputation and client trust. The lack of transparency or disclosure on the part of the employee may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Company Property
Employees are prohibited from any unauthorized use of the company's property, including equipment, materials, or other items (“company property”).
Improper use of company property can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Employees are expected to follow company standards and guidelines for the use of company property, as well as follow all operating instructions. Employees must notify their manager if any company property appears to be damaged or in need of repair.

Health and Safety
Regenta Inc. takes reasonable precautions to ensure that employees have a safe working environment. Safety measures and rules are in place for the protection of all employees, and it is ultimately the responsibility of each employee to help prevent accidents. To ensure a safe workplace, employees should use all safety and protective equipment provided to them and maintain work areas in a safe, clean, and orderly manner, free from hazardous conditions. Employees who observe an unsafe practice or condition should report it to their manager immediately.
In the event of a work accident or injury, employees must notify their manager immediately. Report every injury, regardless of how minor, to your manager immediately. Physical discomfort caused by repetitive tasks must also be reported.
Employees should recognize any potential fire hazards and be aware of fire escape routes and fire drills. In the event of a fire or other emergency, dial 911 immediately. If you hear a fire alarm or other emergency alert system, proceed quickly and calmly to the nearest exit. Failure to report known safety issues or observable hazards may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Hiring Relatives and Significant Others
Regenta Inc.’s policy is that close relatives or individuals who live with but are not legally related to company employees may be hired only if they will not be working directly for or managing their close relative cohabitant. If already employed, they cannot be transferred or promoted into such a reporting relationship. If a close relative or cohabitation relationship is established after employment begins, the employees should disclose this to Pauli Morales, who will decide the appropriate next steps, if any.

Business Expense Reimbursement
Employees may be reimbursed for reasonable, pre-approved expenses incurred in the course of business. These expenses must be approved by your manager in advance. Contact your manager in advance if you have any questions about whether a business expense will be reimbursed.

References
Regenta Inc. will respond to reference requests through Pauli Morales.
Verification of employment: Requests to verify employment will be handled by Pauli Morales. If contacted to verify employment, the company will provide your title and dates of employment.
References
While the company does not provide references or letters of recommendation, Regenta Inc. endorses and will not interfere with an employee's personal request to a colleague or manager to provide a reference or a letter of recommendation. Any such reference is at the discretion of the individual, and they must be clear that their reference is not being made on behalf of the company.

Recording Device Policy
Due to the potential for issues such as invasion of privacy, sexual harassment, and loss of productivity, no employee may use a camera phone function on any phone on company property or while performing work. The use of recorders or other types of voice recording devices anywhere on company property, including to record conversations or activities of other employees or management, or while performing work for Regenta Inc., is also strictly prohibited unless consent was obtained from the person being recorded, the device was provided to you by Regenta Inc., and is used solely for legitimate business purposes. This policy does not restrict employees from taking photographs and making recordings in furtherance of their protected concerted activity under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

Social Media Policy
Information published on any social networking site should not reveal any confidential information and must not disclose any trade secret, such as client information or marketing efforts. This also applies to comments posted on other blogs, forums, and social networking sites. The company respects the right of any employee to maintain a blog, website, or to use social media. All rules regarding confidential and proprietary business information apply in full to blogs, web pages, social sites, X, and similar sites. Any information that cannot be disclosed through a conversation, a note, or an email should not be shared online. Any conduct that is impermissible under the law, if expressed in any other form or forum, is impermissible if expressed online.
Employees should not post content about the company, management, co-workers, or customers that is discriminatory, libelous, or threatening or a violation of the company's policies against discrimination on account of race, age, religion, sex, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or other protected class, status or characteristic.

Protected activities may include, but are not limited to, reporting or assisting in reporting suspected violations of this policy and/or cooperating in investigations or proceedings arising out of a violation of this policy.
Adverse employment action is conduct or action that materially affects the terms and conditions of the employee's employment status or is reasonably likely to deter the employee from engaging in protected activity.

When the investigation has been completed, the company will normally communicate the results of the investigation to the complaining individual, to the alleged harasser, and, if appropriate, to others who are directly involved. If our policy against harassment is found to have been violated, appropriate corrective action, up to and including termination, will be taken against the harasser so that further harassment will be prevented. Both the rights of the alleged harasser and the complainant will be considered in any investigation and subsequent action.
Discipline for violation of this policy may include but is not limited to, reprimand, suspension, demotion, transfer, and discharge. If the company determines that harassment or discrimination occurred, corrective action will be taken. As necessary, the company may monitor any incident of harassment or discrimination to ensure that inappropriate behavior has stopped. In all cases, the company will follow up as necessary to ensure that no individual is retaliated against for making a complaint or cooperating with an investigation.
In addition to our internal complaint procedure, employees may also contact either the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the California Civil Rights Department (CRD) to report unlawful harassment. You must file a complaint with the CRD within three years of the alleged unlawful action. The EEOC and the CRD serve as neutral fact-finders and will attempt to assist the parties in voluntarily resolving their disputes. For more information, contact the Office of Human Resources or the nearest EEOC or CRD office.

California Family Rights Act (CFRA) Leave
Our company provides unpaid family and medical leave to eligible employees in accordance with the California Family Rights Act (CFRA).
Eligibility
To be eligible for CFRA leave:
You must have been employed for at least 12 months (52 weeks) with the company prior to beginning CFRA leave; and
You must have worked for the company at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately before the leave is to start (with exception).
Reasons for Leave
You may take CFRA leave for the following reasons:
The birth of a child, or adoption or foster care placement of a child with you, within one year of the child’s birth, adoption, or foster care placement.
To care for your own serious health condition, your family member's serious health condition, or a designated person’s serious health condition (not including disability due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions).
A qualifying exigency related to your spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent who is a military member on covered active duty or called to covered active duty status (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty).
Family member means your child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or domestic partner.
Designated person means any person related by blood or whose affiliation with you is the equivalent of a familial relationship.
Child means a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, a child of a domestic partner, or a person to whom you stand in loco parentis.
Parent means a biological, foster, or adoptive parent, a stepparent, a legal guardian, or another person who stood in loco parentis to you when you were a child.
Sibling means a person related to another person by blood, adoption, or affinity through a common legal or biological parent.
Leave Usage
Eligible employees may take up to 12 work weeks of leave per leave year. You may elect to use any accrued vacation time or other paid accrued time off that you are eligible to take during the otherwise unpaid portion of the CFRA leave. You also may elect to use any accrued sick leave that you are eligible to take during the otherwise unpaid portion of CFRA leave if the CFRA leave is for your own serious health condition, a qualifying exigency, or any other reason mutually agreed to between you and the company. CFRA leave will run concurrently with other federal/state laws where permitted by law.
Intermittent Leave
When medically necessary, leave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced work schedule.
Notice
If the need for leave is foreseeable (such as the birth of a child or planned medical treatment), you must provide reasonable advance notice and make a reasonable effort to schedule leave so that it will not unduly disrupt company operations. If unforeseeable, provide notice as soon as practical. Notice should include the anticipated timing and duration of the leave.
Failure to comply with these notice rules is grounds for and may result in, deferral of the request for leave until you comply with the notice requirement.
Certification
Where leave is requested for your own or a covered family member's serious health condition, the company may require you to provide certification from your or their healthcare provider.
If leave is for your own serious health condition, certification must include:
The date on which the serious health condition commenced.
The probable duration of the condition.
A statement that, due to a serious health condition, you are unable to perform the function of your position. If leave is for a covered family member's serious health condition, certification must include:
The date on which the serious health condition began.
The probable duration of the condition.
An estimate of the amount of time that the health care provider believes you are needed to care for the family member.
A statement that the family member's serious health condition requires you to provide care during the period of treatment or supervision.
The company may require subsequent recertification of your own serious health condition if additional leave is required.
If the company has reason to doubt the validity of the certification provided, the company may require, at its own expense, that you obtain a second opinion from a healthcare provider designated or approved by the company. If the second opinion differs from the original certification, the company may again require, at its own expense, that you obtain a third opinion from a different healthcare provider, designated or approved jointly by you and the company. The third opinion will be considered final and binding.
Return to Work
If you take leave for your own serious health condition, you must obtain certification from your healthcare provider that you are able to resume work.
Reinstatement
Upon return to work at the end of the leave, you will be placed in your original job or an equivalent job with equivalent pay and benefits. You will not lose any benefits that accrued before leave was taken. You may not, however, be entitled to discretionary raises, promotions, bonus payments, or other benefits that become available during the period of leave.
Benefits
If the company provides you with health benefits under a group health plan, the company will maintain and pay for your health coverage for up to 12 weeks at the same level and under the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if you had not taken CFRA leave.
Failure to Return to Work
If you fail to return to work or fail to request an extension of leave prior to the expiration of the leave, you will be considered to have voluntarily terminated your employment. If you fail to return from leave, the company may require reimbursement of the health insurance premiums paid during the leave under certain circumstances.
Retaliation
The company will not retaliate against employees who request or take leave in accordance with this policy.

California - Voting Leave
Employees are eligible to receive up to a maximum of two hours of paid time off from work to vote if they do not have sufficient nonworking hours while the polls are open. Any additional necessary time off will be unpaid.
Employees who need to take time off during their shift to vote must submit a request to their supervisor in writing at least two days prior to the date of the election. Voting leave must be taken at the beginning or end of the work shift unless otherwise agreed upon by the company and the employee.

California - Equal Employment Opportunity Policy
The company is committed to the principles of equal employment. We are committed to complying with all federal, state, and local laws providing equal employment opportunities, and all other employment laws and regulations. It is our intent to maintain a work environment that is free of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation based on an individual's race (including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles such as braids, locks, and twists), color, religion, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices), national origin (including on the basis of possessing a driver’s license or ID card), ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition (including cancer and genetic characteristics), genetic information, marital status, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, lactation, or related medical conditions), gender (including gender identity and gender expression), age (40 years and over), sexual orientation, reproductive health decisionmaking, veteran and/or military status, requesting or taking leave protected under state or federal law (including the Family and Medical Leave Act or the California Family Rights Act), domestic violence victim status, or any other status protected by federal, state, or local laws, or any combination of protected statuses or characteristics.
The company is dedicated to fulfilling this policy regarding all aspects of employment, including but not limited to recruiting, hiring, placement, transfer, training, promotion, rates of pay, and other compensation, termination, and all other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. The company will conduct a confidential, prompt, and thorough investigation of all allegations of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, or any violation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy. The company will take appropriate corrective and remedial action, if and where warranted. The company prohibits retaliation against any employees who provide information about, complain about, or assist in the investigation of any complaint of discrimination or violation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy.
We are all responsible for upholding this policy. You may discuss questions regarding equal employment opportunities with your managers or any other designated member of management.

California - Final Paycheck
When an employee is discharged from employment, the company will pay the employee all wages due at the time of termination unless an exception applies.
If an employee quits and gives the company at least seventy-two (72) hours' notice, the company will pay the employee all wages due at the time of quitting. If the employee fails to provide at least seventy-two (72) hours' notice prior to quitting, the company will pay the employee all wages due within seventy-two (72) hours after the time of quitting. Employees may request that their final wages be mailed to a designated address. The date of the mailing is considered the date of payment.
When an employee leaves employment due to a labor dispute, the company will pay the employee by the next regular payday.

California - Payroll Practices and Compensation Policy
Employees may be required to work overtime. In these instances, employees will be given as much advance notice as practical.
All non-exempt employees will receive overtime pay at the rate of 1.5 times the employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in one workday and for all hours worked over 40 in one workweek.
In addition, all non-exempt employees will receive overtime pay at the rate of double the employee’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 12 hours in one workday and for all hours worked over eight on the seventh consecutive day of work in a workweek.
On each payday, employees will receive a statement showing gross pay, deductions, and net pay, and any other information required by state law. If you have any questions about this policy or the company’s payroll procedures, or overtime policy, please contact Human Resources.

California - Bereavement Leave
The company believes in the importance of offering its employees time away to grieve the loss of a loved one. The purpose of this policy is to outline the eligibility and procedure for taking Bereavement Leave, as guaranteed by California state law.
Eligibility
This policy applies to all employees of California employers with five (5) or more employees. Eligible employees can take up to five (5) days of unpaid/paid/combination protected leave upon the death of a spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, state-registered domestic partner, and parent-in-law – the definitions of which are outlined in the California Family Rights Act. This leave is in addition to the available CFRA leave provided to employees each year. Employees must have been employed with the company for at least 30 days before the commencement of the leave.
Bereavement leave does not need to be taken consecutively. However, it does need to be completed within three (3) months of the passing of the employee’s family member. There is no limit on how much bereavement time is taken per year. In the tragic event that an employee experiences multiple deaths in one year, they will be eligible to take up to five (5) days of protected leave for each occurrence.
Employees must notify their supervisor or Human Resources as soon as reasonably possible. The company may require documentation such as a death certificate, a published obituary, or written verification of death, burial, or memorial services from a mortuary, funeral home, burial society, crematorium, religious institution, or governmental agency within 30 days of the first day of leave.

California - Reproductive Loss Leave
The company provides leave for employees following a reproductive loss event. This policy applies to companies with five or more employees. Employees must have worked for the company for at least 30 days.
Reproductive loss includes:
Miscarriage
Stillbirth
Failed adoption or failed surrogacy
Unsuccessful assisted reproduction
Eligible employees may take up to 5 days of reproductive loss leave and must use the leave within 3 months of the event. If an employee experiences multiple losses in a year, total leave may not exceed 20 days in a 12-month period. The company will maintain confidentiality and will not retaliate against an employee for using this leave.
Reproductive Loss Leave is unpaid; however, employees may use any accrued and applicable paid leave benefits, such as PTO, concurrent with Reproductive Loss Leave if preferred.

California - Disability Accommodation Policy
Purpose
The company is committed to complying with all laws that protect qualified individuals with disabilities. When requested, the company will provide a reasonable accommodation for any known physical or mental disability of a qualified individual, provided the requested accommodation does not create an undue hardship for the company or pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others in the workplace or to the requesting employee.
Eligibility
This policy applies to all applicants and employees and extends to all aspects of the company’s employment practices, including recruiting, hiring, discipline, termination, promotions, transfers, compensation, benefits, training, leaves of absence, and other terms and conditions of employment.
Procedures
To request an accommodation to perform the essential functions of an employee’s job, the employee must notify Human Resources or submit a written request to their supervisor. An employee requesting accommodation should include in the request his or her suggestion for accommodation.
Reasonable accommodations may include modification of a workstation, change in job duties or schedule, reassignment to another position, or time off (with or without pay), provided that such exceptions do not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others in the workplace or to the requesting employee.
Once the company is aware of the need for accommodation, it will engage with the employee in an interactive process to identify possible accommodations.
Employees are encouraged to use this procedure without fear of retaliation. Employees who believe that they have been treated in a manner not in accordance with this policy should notify Human Resources.

California - Accommodations for Nursing Mothers Policy
The company is required by law to provide requesting employees who are nursing mothers with certain accommodations to express milk upon request. Accordingly, the company will provide nursing mothers with:
Reasonable break time to express milk for their infant child(ren) each time the mother needs to express milk; and
A private room or other location near their work area, other than a restroom, which is shielded from view and free from intrusion, to express breast milk.
Requesting Accommodation
If you need accommodation, contact your manager. If the company cannot provide break time or a location that complies with the above, the company will provide you with a written response.
Break Times
Regarding break times, you may use your regular paid rest breaks or may take other reasonable break times when needed. If possible, the break time should run concurrently with a scheduled meal and rest breaks already provided to you. If the break time cannot run concurrently with meal and rest breaks already provided or additional time is needed, break times will be unpaid except where federal or state law dictates otherwise.
Milk Storage
Expressed milk can be stored in company refrigerators, refrigerators provided in the lactation room or other locations, or a personal cooler. Sufficiently mark or label your milk to avoid confusion for other employees sharing the refrigerator.
Retaliation
The company will not retaliate against employees who request or obtain accommodation in accordance with this policy.
Right to File Complaint
If you feel the company is not providing you with adequate break time and/or a place to express milk as provided for in this policy, you may file a report/claim with the Labor Commissioner's Bureau of Field Enforcement (BOFE) at the BOFE office nearest your place of employment. The complaint must be filed within three years of the alleged unlawful action.
In addition, if you believe you have been a victim of retaliation for either asserting a right to lactation accommodation or for complaining to the Labor Commissioner about the failure of the company to provide this accommodation, you may file a retaliation claim with the Labor Commissioner's Office under Labor Code § 98.7. This claim must be filed within six months of the alleged retaliation.

California - Meals and Rest Periods Policy
The company strives to provide a safe and healthy work environment and comply with all federal and state regulations regarding meal and rest periods. Check with your supervisor regarding procedures and schedules for meal and rest periods.
The company requests that employees observe and accurately record meal periods in time and attendance records. If you know in advance that you may not be able to take an uninterrupted scheduled meal or rest period, let your supervisor know; in addition, notify your supervisor as soon as possible if you are unable to take or are prohibited from taking an uninterrupted scheduled meal or rest period. Meal and rest periods are intended to provide employees with an opportunity to be away from work, and employees are not permitted to perform any work during meal and rest periods.
Meal Periods
If you work more than five hours in a workday, you will be provided an unpaid, uninterrupted 30-minute meal period no later than the end of your fifth hour of work. Non-exempt employees must "clock out" from the timekeeping system for this period. If you work fewer than six hours in a workday, you may mutually agree with your supervisor to waive the meal period.
If you work more than 10 hours in a workday, you will be provided a second unpaid, uninterrupted 30-minute meal period no later than the end of your tenth hour of work. Depending on your occupation, if you work no more than 12 hours in a workday and have taken the first meal period, you may mutually agree with your supervisor to waive the second meal period.
See your supervisor for procedures related to requesting to waive a meal period in the above circumstances.
Rest Periods
If you are non-exempt, you will also be provided paid, 10-minute rest periods based on total hours worked daily, and you are not required to "clock out" from the timekeeping system. You will receive 10 minutes of uninterrupted rest time for every four hours of work, or a major portion of each four hours worked. Accordingly, if you work:
Less than three and a half hours, you are not entitled to a rest period.
Three and a half to six hours, you are entitled to a 10-minute rest period.
Six to ten hours, you are entitled to two 10-minute rest periods.
Ten to fourteen hours, you are entitled to three 10-minute rest periods. Rest periods are to be taken in the middle of the four-hour work period when possible.
Rest periods should not be combined or added to meal periods or used to start work later or end work early. In order to prevent heat illness, the company provides cool-down and rest periods to employees working outdoors in accordance with state requirements.

California - Literacy Leave
If employees need time off to attend an adult education program for literacy assistance, they should inform their direct supervisor or the Human Resources Department. The company will attempt to make reasonable accommodations by providing unpaid time off or an adjusted work schedule, provided the accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the company. The policy applies to companies with more than 25 employees.

California - Employee Personnel Records Policy
The company maintains personnel and payroll records of employees. It is important to provide us with current information regarding name, address, telephone number, insurance changes, tax exemptions, emergency contacts, and other relevant information. If you wish to review your personnel file or payroll records, please send a written request to the Human Resources Department.

California - Military Spouse Leave
Under California’s Military Spouse Leave Law, eligible employees who work 20 or more hours per week or more, can take unpaid military spouse leave for up to 10 days while a military spouse or registered domestic partner is away on deployment. If an employee needs to request time off for this leave, the employee must inform their supervisor immediately. This policy applies to companies with 20 or more employees.

California - Anti-sexual harassment training policy
California law requires that the company provide 1 hour of sexual harassment and abusive conduct prevention training to nonsupervisory employees, and 2 hours of sexual harassment and abusive conduct prevention training to supervisory employees, every two years. This policy applies to companies with five or more employees.
Training will be provided at no cost to employees, either virtually or in person. The company requires employees to submit their completion of training certificates to Human Resources.

California - Pregnancy Disability Leave
If employees are disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, they are eligible to take a pregnancy disability leave (PDL). If affected by pregnancy or a related medical condition, employees are also eligible to transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position or to less strenuous or hazardous duties, if such a transfer is medically advisable and can be reasonably accommodated. Employees disabled by qualifying conditions may also be entitled to other reasonable accommodations where doing so is medically necessary. In addition, if it is medically advisable for employees to take intermittent leave or work a reduced schedule, the company may require them to transfer temporarily to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits that can better accommodate recurring periods of leave. This policy applies to companies with five or more employees.
The PDL is for any period(s) of actual disability caused by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition up to four (4) months per pregnancy. For purposes of this policy, "four months" means time off for the number of days the employee would normally work within the four (4) calendar months (one-third of a year or 17 1/3 weeks), following the commencement date of taking a pregnancy disability leave. For a full-time employee who works 40 hours per week, "four months" means 693 hours of leave entitlement, based on 40 hours per week times 17 1/3 weeks. Employees working a part-time schedule will have their PDL calculated on a pro-rata basis.
The PDL does not need to be taken in one continuous period of time but can be taken on an intermittent basis pursuant to the law.
Time off needed for prenatal or postnatal care, severe morning sickness, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, doctor-ordered bed rest, postpartum depression, loss or end of pregnancy, and recovery from childbirth or loss or end of pregnancy are all covered by PDL.
To receive a reasonable accommodation, obtain a transfer, or take a PDL, employees must provide sufficient notice so the company can make appropriate plans. Thirty days' advance notice is required if the need for reasonable accommodation, transfer, or PDL is foreseeable, otherwise as soon as practicable if the need is emergency or unforeseeable.
Employees are required to obtain a certification from their healthcare provider of the need for pregnancy disability leave or the medical advisability of an accommodation or for a transfer. The certification is sufficient if it contains: (1) a description of the requested reasonable accommodation or transfer; (2) a statement describing the medical advisability of the reasonable accommodation or transfer because of pregnancy; and (3) the date on which the need for a reasonable accommodation or transfer became or will become medically advisable and the estimated duration of the reasonable accommodation or transfer.
PDL is unpaid. At the employee's option, the employee can use any accrued vacation time or other accrued paid time off as part of the PDL before taking the remainder of the leave on an unpaid basis. The company requires, however, that the employee use any available sick time during the PDL. The substitution of any paid leave will not extend the duration of the PDL. Employees who participate in the company's group health insurance plan will continue to participate in the plan while on PDL under the same terms and conditions as if they were working. Benefit continuation under PDL is distinct from benefit continuation for employees who also take birth bonding leave under the California Family Rights Act. Employees should make arrangements for payment of their share of the insurance premiums.
The company encourages employees to contact the California Employment Development Department regarding eligibility for state disability insurance for the unpaid portion of the leave.

California - Civil Air Patrol Leave
Eligible employees who have been employed with the company for 90 days or more may take a leave of absence to respond to an emergency operational mission of the California Wing of the Civil Air Patrol. An eligible employee may take up to 10 days of unpaid leave per year. Leave is limited to three days on any one occasion, but can be extended if authorized by the government entity that called for the mission and would not cause an undue hardship on the company. This policy applies to companies with 15 or more employees.
Employees who take Civil Air Patrol leave will be reinstated to the same position they had prior to commencing leave with the equivalent seniority status, benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.

California - Time Off For Volunteer Firefighters, Reserve Peace Officers & Emergency Rescue Personnel
Employees who are volunteer firefighters, reserve peace officers, or emergency rescue personnel are permitted to take unpaid time off, not to exceed 14 days per calendar year, to perform emergency duty. This policy applies to all California employers with at least one employee.
If the employee needs to request time off under this policy, they must notify their supervisor immediately.
While all employers must allow emergency responders time off to perform their emergency duties, employers with 50 or more employees must also allow them to take unpaid time off, not exceeding 14 days per calendar year, to engage in fire, law enforcement, or emergency rescue training.

California - Business Expense Reimbursement
Remote work expense reimbursement
Remote workers may be entitled to partial or total reimbursement for expenses incurred in conjunction with performing work remotely, including but not limited to home office equipment, cell phone expenses, and internet costs.
In order to be eligible for reimbursement, expenses must be required and unavoidable in order to perform the job duties. In the event the company provides reimbursement for material equipment such as a desk, a printer, or office supplies, those materials thus become the property of the company and may be required to be returned to the company upon separation.
The company reserves the right to request proof of expenses, including but not limited to, bills, receipts, or payment confirmations.
Expense reimbursement for general business expenses
Reasonable and pre-approved expenses may be reimbursed by the company for certain items, including, but not limited to, conference registrations, meals, transportation, lodging, and mileage. When an employee uses their personal vehicle for approved purposes, the company will reimburse on a per-mile basis at the IRS-approved rate.
Employees are required to provide a report of expenses along with paid receipts in order to receive reimbursement.

California - Bone Marrow & Organ Donation Leave Policy
Eligible employees may request leave to donate bone marrow or an organ.
Eligibility

Amount of Leave
Employees may take five (5) consecutive or nonconsecutive days of paid leave per year for bone marrow donation.
The company may require that employees take up to five (5) days of earned but unused sick, vacation, or paid time off for bone marrow donation.

The company may require that employees take up to two (2) weeks of earned but unused sick, vacation, or paid time off for organ donation.
This leave may not be taken concurrently with FMLA leave or CFRA leave.
Documentation
The company may require documentation and verification of bone marrow or organ donation status and that the donation is medically necessary.

Los Angeles, CA - Paid Sick Leave
The company provides paid sick leave to employees who work for 30 days or more within a year and who work at least 2 hours per calendar week within the geographical limits of the city of Los Angeles.
Accrual and Use of Paid Sick Leave
For every 30 hours worked, employees accrue 1 hour of paid sick leave. Employees can use up to 80 hours of sick leave per year.
Employees may begin to use accrued sick leave 90 days after the commencement of employment. Employees can accrue up to 72 hours of paid sick leave at any given time but can only use 48 hours of accrued sick leave during any calendar year.
An employee may use paid sick leave for the diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, an employee or an employee's family member. Employees may use paid sick leave for themselves or a family member, or for any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship. An employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking may use sick leave to:
obtain any relief, including, but not limited to, a temporary restraining order, restraining order, or other injunctive relief, to help ensure the health, safety, or welfare of the victim or their child;
seek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking;
obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking;
obtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or
participate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, including temporary or permanent relocation.
Carryover
Paid sick leave carries over from year to year and is subject to the accrual cap. The company is not required to provide financial reimbursement for paid sick leave upon the employee’s termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment, for accrued paid sick leave that has not been used.
Notice
If your need for leave is foreseeable, you must provide as much advance notice as possible. If unforeseeable, provide notice as soon as practical. If known, notice should include the expected length of the absence.
Documentation
The company may request documentation verifying the appropriate use of leave.
Payment Upon Termination
You will not be paid for any unused sick leave when your employment ends.
Reinstatement of Sick Leave Upon Rehire
The company will reinstate previously accrued, unused sick leave if you separate and are rehired within one year.
Interaction with Other Leave
If the company has a paid leave policy, such as PTO or vacation policy that allows an employee to use paid leave and that policy is at least the same amount of time earned under this policy, this policy does not provide any additional paid time off. In the event that state and local law conflict, the more generous of the two sick leave provisions will apply.
Retaliation
The company will not retaliate against employees who request or take leave in accordance with this policy.

Los Angeles, CA - Fair Workweek Ordinance
The Fair Workweek Ordinances (FWWO) of the City and County of Los Angeles aim to promote the health, safety, and welfare of retail workers by ensuring a predictable work schedule, stability for employees and their families, and opportunities for additional work hours.

Covered Employees
A Covered Employee is any individual who, in any particular week, performs at least two hours of work within the geographic boundaries of the City of Los Angeles or Los Angeles County for a Covered Employer and is entitled to earn the California minimum wage.
If the company is a Covered Employer and you are a Covered Employee, the remaining provisions of this policy will apply.

The company will provide employees with written notice of their work schedule at least 14 days before the start of the work period and will notify employees of any employer-initiated schedule changes after the required advance notice.
Employees have the right to decline any schedule changes not included in the Work Schedule. If an employee consents to schedule changes, the consent must be in writing.
Offer of Work to Existing Employees
Before hiring new employees or contractors, the company will offer additional work hours to existing qualified employees. Employees accepting additional hours under this section are not entitled to Predictability Pay.
Predictability Pay
The company will provide Predictability Pay for schedule changes unless exceptions apply.
If the company changes an employee’s scheduled date, time, or location, the company will pay the employee:
One additional hour of pay for changes that do not reduce hours or that increase hours by more than 15 minutes.

Predictability Pay is not required if:
The employee requests the change.
The employee voluntarily accepts a schedule change due to another worker’s absence.
The employee accepts additional hours under an Offer of Work.
Work hours are reduced due to the employee’s violation of the law or company policy.
Operations are disrupted by legal or force majeure circumstances.

Employees must have at least 10 hours of rest between shifts unless they provide written consent.
If an employee works within 10 hours of their last shift, they must receive time and a half for that shift.
Safety Concerns
A Covered Employee in LA County who is concerned for their personal or family safety may request that their work schedule not be posted or transmitted to other employees. This request can be made in writing or verbally, and the Covered Employer must promptly abide by the Covered Employee’s request.
